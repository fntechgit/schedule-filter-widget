One minute he’s analyzing a show budget and the next he’s discussing creative solutions to a technical puzzle or communication need. This balance of right brain/left brain has been honed through many years of event experience, along with continual education, including his master’s degree in business. A gifted moneyman, Grif owned/managed an accounting firm, communications company, and software firm before going back to his true passion, event production. Making roosters jealous, Grif is generally up before the crack of dawn blueprinting next steps, researching new ideas, and getting a jump on the day. </p>\n<p>Grif’s words to live by: Focus on being kind and having a positive attitude;
